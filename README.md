PolyBuddies

# Description:
PolyBuddies is a platform where students can form sport teams and find their sport
buddies at Cal Poly.

#Overview:
Most of the time, students cannot find buddies to work out or not have enough players to
form a basketball or volleyball team to play a game. PolyBuddies can solve this issue. Unlike
other Sport Buddy applications in the market, PolyBuddies strongly focuses on forming teams
and finding suitable teammates at Cal Poly. It provides a platform where students can search
their teammates based their interests and partner preferences, such as experience level,
competitiveness, availabilities and the type of sport in Cal Poly. For occasional players, they will
be able to see the population in the gym, basketball court and soccer field on Google Map so that
they can decide the best time to the gym or the courts.

Furthermore, competitive students or athletics can schedule games with other teams
through the platform. In the application, the existing teams are able to post their schedules on the
application, and other teams can contact them based on their availabilities, experience levels, etc.
In addition to the scheduling feature, if the time is allowed by the end of the quarter, I would like
to build a chat engine in the application so that users get to know each other prior to forming
teams in order to avoid personalitiesâ€™ conflicts or other bad experiences.

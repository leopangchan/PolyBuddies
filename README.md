PostTeamPage:
I put three text fields for the team's name, the skill level and the sport type. The data is sent by clicking "Confirm". In order to see whether it's successful, you can switch back to ViewTeam and check whether the new data is in the database.

ViewTeamPage:
I plan to use tableViewController. I successfully fetch data from firebase so far. Entire database is output in the console when the user switch to the tableViewController.

Map:
Ultimately, the pins' locations will be determined the data from firebase. I put two pins at soccer field and the recreational center for examples.
